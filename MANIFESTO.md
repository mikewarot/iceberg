# The Iceberg Manifesto

adapted from the original twitter thread at https://twitter.com/mikewarot/status/1591006254612168706

## 1 - Introduction

So, anyone interested in build a new ship before this one sinks?

We're always talking about how trivial Twitter would be to replace... I'm sure it could be done in the time remaining (if t > 2 weeks)

    Quote from Ben Crew @BenjaminCrew1
    For those keeping track, Twitter is currently in the stage of the Titanic sinking where the band is continuing to play and Billy Zane is running around the ship with a gun


Seriously... You've got a flow of posts, of different sorts, that have to be tied to a poster, and rated against a number of things, including who would be offended, what countries want to put you in jail for saying it, what other people (including The Algorithm) think of it

## Ranking / Voting across dimensions

Rating/Voting/Ranking is all about assigning yes/no, or series of emoticons in many platforms... 

Why limit it to binary, or a few choices?

Data is almost zero cost, there shouldn't be only one rating/voting/rank

That SINGLE rank is a big reason things suck in many networks 

It becomes a popularity contest, and the Checkmarks/ Rock Stars/Cool Kids win, and everyone else is in the noise. 

What if you could signal interest in a new direction, and have a side chat along that rating?

Nuance would have a chance, and you could find common interests

## We all have Multiple Identities

We all have different identities, I'm grumpy man on the internet, former IT guy at a marketing company, a guy who made involute gears in a job shop, programmer, guy who learned a bit of marketing

those are all different interests, I should have a way of keeping them separate

Separate identities, roles, whatever you want to call it... but they should all still tie back to me, the person, with varying degrees of anonymity.

On the deep end

Like Edward Snowden - At some point in life, I might need to be able to say things without giving enemies my location, or the ability to put words in my mouth

on the lighter side of things, I just want to post jokes about sine plates to machinists

jokes about democrats to political buddies, etc.

we all have many different identities, but sometimes we're filling a role at work, club, government, etc.

that's something tied to a job

I follow @USArmySMA - Michael Grinston's account that he's currently in charge of in his role in the US Army, but I think it would still be interesting to hear his insights after he's moved on.

There should be a way to make that happen... split official/personal roles, cleanly

So, organizations need to secure accounts against many threats, but still let their workers use them, subject to revocation.

It's a temporary endorsement of a person, with at least one start and end time.

More data, dimensions, but there are no real limits in this age... 

Except of course, that complexity goes through the roof.

## Thanksgiving Challenge to myself / Open Source Innovation to the Rescue

You can't possibly design all of it in one sitting, but if you state it all up front, and meet the goals over time, a community can do amazing things in short order. 

I think the open source world can do it in a week

We could have a janky, barely working specification and at least one implementation that does all the above (and below...) in a week.

New implementations would be forked off almost instantly, and the bad implementations would be pruned or cleaned up and fixed

Myself, I'm not the open source world... just a Pascal programmer, so I'll give myself until Thanksgiving

## Types of media

Oh... and then there's the stuff... there are multiple kinds of stuff.... 

- Text, like this, essays, books
- Audio as in music, pod-casts, live streams, radio, etc...
- Pictures, Movies, programs etc...

## Linking to bigger stuff, media, etc

Links to all those things not fitting in some fixed length need to be linked

The link to that content needs a good description, so that we can have an idea what it is before we retrieve it, a link that can be archived, rated, etc.. just like any other post.

Linking to things on the internet exposes risk, and has to be done carefully for many reasons

The link MUST include a good checksum, SHA512 or whatever the cryptography kids think is good.. and possibly more than one of those.

## Approval, Signing Messages, Ratings, etc.

Heck, you could even do that with posts, giving PGP like power to prevent impersonation, sign ratings, etc.

Let 1000 seals of approval bloom

## Private messages, and letting the NSA read your messages as a choice

There needs to be a way to make things secret, varying levels of secret, even though it could be abused, I think US people would grudgingly accept the NSA, but NOT the KSA, etc. reading their email, if they could be sure it wasn't abused (as it has been), make it transparent

If the NSA wants to read my stuff... let them give me a public key to allow their private key (and only them) to read my stuff... and let me have a way to make sure they can do so.

Let all governments, businesses, parents, etc. do the same, bake oversight in, in the open

## Signing things to prevent impersonation, and the Twitter Checkmark

On the other hand, I don't want people impersonating me, or my friends, employers, bank, government, etc. There needs to be a public/private key system for keeping that all from happening.

Twitter used to handle this in a semi-reasonable manner... before the Iceberg

## Succession planning, contingencies, vacation, etc. -- CALL FOR IDEAS

Yet, we need to be able to have people care for us and act on our behalf at times

When we die, get sick, take a vacation, change roles at work, etc... we need to be able to pass on control, and specify why, as part of the infrastructure.

I'm WAYYYY open for ideas here. I want my heirs, personal, ideological, etc. to be able to carry on with my blessing

## Conclusion -- pause for now

So, that's a bit of a rant... I'll pause here at #19 blocks, and probably think of theses 20-95 later in this minifesto

We CAN build a new ship, a better ship, before things sink... the first one will sink into the mud, the second will burn, the third burn then sink.... ;-) 

Thanks for your time and attention
